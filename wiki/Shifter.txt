=== Mechanical Changes ===
==== General Changes ====
Shifters have an innate attunement to Water. If they aren't pacted to a spirit, they will be treated as having a Water pact of strength equal to their class level.  (If the shifter also has Monk and/or Assassin levels, the highest of these classes is used to determine innate Attunement). 

Shifters can edit their head model freely using the radial menu. 

Shifters are a religious class and can consecrate altars.  They must worship one of the Beast Gods. 
----
==== Notes, Tips, and Interesting Bits: ====    
Shifters have access to a wide range of forms.  In general, these can be divided up into:
* Utility forms (e.g. Kobold Commando with stealth skills, Pixie with spells, Troll with regeneration)
* Forms that use a creature weapon (e.g. animal forms) - these forms will be improved by creature weapon feats.
* Forms that use a weapon (e.g. Lizardman using a whip) - these forms will be improved by the relevant weapon skill feats (e.g. Weapon Focus).

Shifter spells stack with the potion versions, and potions can be used in polymorph.  This makes the Kensai path a very interesting choice.  On the one hand, it will be a straight improvement to all your forms, and your innate abilities replace the need for potions.  On the other, it removes your ability to use healing potions (the only healing items usable in polymorph) and you miss out on the chance to stack your innate ability boosts with potions for double effect.  A non kensai Shifter of high enough level can max all their ability scores using potions and their innate SLAs, thanks to the spell focuses in Transmutation that they get. 

Shifters' ability to change their appearance and race at will makes them excellent infiltrators.

Harpies have the Bard Song and Curse Song abilities.  Their Bard class level is considered equivalent to their Shifter class level when singing, and their Perform skill is considered to be the character's SL. (The character's Perform skill, if any, and any modifiers to it are ignored).
