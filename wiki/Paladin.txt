=== Mechanical Changes ===

Clerics and paladins get a caster level increase depending on their piety. Its piety/10 rounded down to the next decimal. So a cleric with 89% piety would get +8 CL on spells they cast. And yes. That means with a negative piety you will get -CL. 

Divine magic has unique properties on this server, please note the changes mentioned in [[Magic_Systems]]

==== Notes, Tips, and Interesting Bits: ====   
Unlike most divine caster paladins must be at least level 4 to gain access to their spells.  Beyond that they work like all other divine casters and already know all spells for every circle of spells.  They only need added spell slots through equipment or feats to have access to them.
