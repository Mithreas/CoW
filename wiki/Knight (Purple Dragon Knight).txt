Prerequisites: 1 BAB, Discipline 4 Ranks, Any Alignment.<br />
The maximum level for this class is 10, instead of 5.<br />
Upon taking your first PDK level, '''after changing areas,''' a conversation will appear asking if you want to choose one of the following traditions:


====Knightly Traditions====

There are three traditions of Knight, that focus on different aspects of the class.  You will be asked to select your Tradition shortly after taking your first level in Knight.
* Knight Vanguard. The Knight Vanguard is the scourge of his enemies, scattering all before her.
* Knight Protector. The Knight Protector is the defender of the weak, and stalwart comrade-at-arms.
* Knight Valiant. The Knight Valiant inspires all around her to feats of heroism.

The Tradition of your Order will determine which Knightly abilities improve.

| Heroic Shield

| 12 Hours
| Instant Action/Targeted
| The Knight designates a friendly target as a Ward, automatically applying a [[Console_command#-guard|-guard]] to them. The Ward gains 5% + 1% per 2 Knight Levels (10% at level 10) damage immunity to all damage types, as well as 1/+1 DR. Additionally, the designated Ward benefits more from the knightly abilities described below. Using the ability on a different ally before the duration ends will remove the buffs and guard from the previous Ward. Using the ability on the Ward again, before the effect expires, (12 IG Hours) will disable guard on the target, but leave the DR and DI active.

===Notes===
*All Knight abilities can be bought from a trainer. You need to have SL~8-12 to do so.
*All the abilities of the Knight are considered extraordinary effects, and thus immune to dispels.
*You must change areas to get the message to choose a tradition after taking the first PDK level.
*For the purposes of PDK feats, your PDK level or SL/5 is counted- whichever is higher.
