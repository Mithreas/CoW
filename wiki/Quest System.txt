Each faction has an NPC who gives out quests.  Quests can be of 5 types:

* Retrieve item(s). Character must fetch a number of items of the same type.
* Kill NPC. Character must kill an NPC.
* Messenger quest. Character must carry an item from the quest giver to another NPC, carry an item from the other NPC to the quest giver, or both.
* Help NPC. Character must find another NPC and do a quest for them.
* Patrol areas. Character must visit a number of areas on a patrol.

Many Quest NPCs will only appear when needed for quests.  Some quests are repeatable - they generally offer a lower reward but can be done once per day.  

All quests have a level range associated with them, and will only be offered to PCs within that level range.  This means if you level up, it might be worth checking for new quests.
