'''Race''' represents a creature's bloodline or ancestry.  In Anemoi there are currently six playable races, but only 3 are available to first time players.

__TOC__


==Introduction ==
Human PCs start in an island city. The three noble houses contest with one another for resources and dominance, while beneath the surface (and the slums of UnderCity) lurks a sinister threat led by the mysterious “Dark One”. Humans do not have access to arcane classes (bard, wizard, sorcerer) or druid.

Halfling PCs start amid green fields, in one of many cosy villages on a nearby peninsula. Despite being skilled farmers (and possessing mild nature magic), their fields and homes are threatened by an infestation of hostile fey, which seem intent on wiping them out. Halflings do not have access to arcane or divine classes (wizard/sorcerer or cleric/paladin) but can be druids and bards.

Elven PCs start amid the lakes and woodlands of the mainland. Their main concern is a virulent plague, coupled with the inherent tendency of their magical nature to rise again as undead following death. Elves do not have access to divine classes (cleric/paladin).

There are three other races, but you can't start with them on your first character - they need you to unlock them.  This is mainly because they have lore implications and I'd like players to have a passing knowledge of the lore before playing one of these characters.

Half-Elves and Elflings are the children of races at war, and hence rare in the current time period.  They are often lone wanderers, or living in small enclaves and trying to avoid the war.  To play one, you have to have discovered a place where half-elves live in the world, and create your character as an Elf (in the new character area you will get the option to change their race).  Elflings, being rarer, require a Normal [[Awards|award]] to play. 

Shapechangers are created in the frozen Northern tundra, but often live among the other races... undetected.  To get the option to create a Shapechanger, you need to have an available major [[Awards|award]], have the [[Achievements|achievements]] for discovering 4 different shapechanger nests, and not have chosen a faction (so don't pick a faction before you pick your subrace!).
