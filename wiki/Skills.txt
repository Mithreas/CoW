== General Info ==

Some skills on Anemoi work differently and may also have additional functionality.  If not noted they function the same as in the regular game.  When purchasing additional skill points by a [[ feats| trainer, ]] a skill is considered a class skill for a character as long as they have taken a level in the class that is proficient with that skill.
