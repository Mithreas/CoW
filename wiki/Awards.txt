=Earning Awards=
An Award is a reward for retiring a character.  There are three tiers of Award.
* A Minor award is granted to any player who deletes a character of [[Fixed_Level_advancement_system|System Level]] 15 or higher.
* A Normal award is granted to any player who deletes a character of SL 50 or higher.
* A Major award is granted to any player who deletes a character of SL 100 or higher.

Deletion can either be via the console command (-delete_character), or via permadeath via the few means in the module that bring it about.

=Spending Awards=
Awards may be spent at character creation to add a boon to your character.  This may include
* Access to restricted races or subraces, currently:
** Elfling, requires Normal award
** Shapechanger, requires Major award
* A reduction in ECL, making XP gains faster and feat purchases cheaper (-1 for Minor award, -2 for Normal, -3 for Major).

In addition, any character who has a reward used on them gains crafting XP faster (10% for Minor award, 25% for Normal, 50% for Major).
