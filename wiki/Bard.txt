==== Notes, Tips, and Interesting Bits: ====     
The bonus to perform from bard song is a soft bonus.  It is counted along side equipment, gifts, and other buffs but caps at +50.  This in addition to your maximum charisma modifier will determine your characters cap for bard song.  25th level bard song and 75 perform is a typical ceiling, though higher is possible.   <br />
