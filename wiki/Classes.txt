And the following prestige classes are restricted:
* No Red Dragon Disciples

You cannot ordinarily mix classes from more than one of the following lists on the same character.  (So a Wiz/Sorc is allowed, but not a Wiz/Shifter).  This is because the powers of these classes are granted by the gods (so yes, in a sense, all major magics are "divine" here).  If hypothetically you were able to find a deity who could offer Shifter and Wizard magics together, then you could take them on one character.  I'm not promising that such a deity exists...
