== Feats ==     
All characters can pay gold coins to trainers in exchange for learning a new feat  The trainer will give you the selection of feats that you currently qualify for and are able to select.  When you have decided on which feat to purchase your System Level (SL) will increase. The higher a character's ECL adjustment the more expensive the first feat will cost them, while lower ECL characters will get to spend less.  <br />
From then on every feat will cost 500 coins more than the last feat you purchased and there is no limit to the amount of feats you can buy.  Once you become SL 31 you will be allowed to begin purchasing epic feats.<br />  
  
Feats that stack and can be taken multiple times such as Great Strength can generally only be a maximum of four times one notable exception is Epic Toughness which can only be taken twice.<br />    

Every trainer is only able to train a few classes himself, some trainers for the more exotic prestige classes might be hard to find. (And you can only learn general feats, or feats for which you have the relevant class!  See class pages for class-specific feats)<br />
  
Some of the requirements for feats have been changed to allow for a more flexible character build system.  All feats and their requirements are listed below.<br />
