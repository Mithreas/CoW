=Training system=

*All characters can pay gold coins to trainers in exchange for learning a new feat.
*The trainer will give you the selection of feats that you currently qualify for and are able to select. 
*Trainers can only train you in the classes they offer, prestige class trainers will need to be found.
*When you have decided on which feat to purchase your System Level (SL) will increase and you will also receive an additional crafting point to allocate to a tradeskill.
*Tradeskill points system is not currently used for anything.
*ECL is added to SL to determine feat cost, 500gp per effective level. 
*The minimum cost is 3000gp (for up to 6 SL+ECL).
*From then on every feat will cost 500 coins more than the last feat you purchased and there is no limit to the amount of feats you can buy. 
*Once you become SL 31 you will be allowed to begin purchasing epic feats.

*Feats that stack and can be taken multiple times such as Great Strength can generally only be a maximum of four times one notable exception is Epic Toughness which can only be taken twice. 
*Keep these epic stat feats in mind as they can be used to qualify for epic feats.
**Example- A character starts with 18 dex, you give him 1 dex from level ups, and buy 4 great dex epic feats to meet the stat requirement for epic dodge.

*Some of the requirements for feats have been changed to allow for a more flexible character build system. All feats and their requirements are listed below.
