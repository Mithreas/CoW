DRAFT - STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND SUBJECT TO (even more) CHANGE (than usual)   
     
The Shaman draws upon beast magic to strengthen themselves and their allies.

The Shaman has its own spell list focused around Transmutation, Illusion and Conjuration spells - list below.  It learns and casts spells like a Sorcerer, using Wisdom as its casting stat.  The Shaman has a chance to regain a spell slot when they or their allies kill enough hit dice of creatures (blood makes the grass grow!).
