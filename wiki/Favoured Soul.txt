DEPRECATED - existing characters will continue to work but new ones cannot be created.  There is now a [[Favoured Soul (Class)]]

A favoured soul is a Cleric path that's akin to a divine sorcerer, a natural channel for their deity's powers.  

Favoured souls gain
- Spontaneous casting of cleric spells, as described below
- Reflex as a favoured save.

Favoured souls lose 
- Domains - both the powers and the additional spell selections
- The Heavy Armour feat (but can select or train the feat after start)
- Turn Undead (and hence the ability to use powers that key off it, like Divine Might). 

For all other purposes they follow Cleric progression (BAB, Will and Fortitude saves, HP etc.).

===Favoured soul spellcasting===
A favoured soul selects spells to memorise as usual... but they can cast any of those memorised spells a total number of times equal to their number of spell slots.  For example, a character who as 3 level 2 spell slots and memorises Bull's Strength, Eagle's Splendor and Owl's Wisdom could Bull's Strength 3 times, or Owl's Wisdom twice and Eagle's Splendor once, or any other combination to a total of three spells.
