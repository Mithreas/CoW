'''Weather''' is randomly generated around Arelith and reflects to some extend location of area and time of the year. With the exception of a few mechanically represented cases, it is up to the players how much weather effects will be reflected in their roleplay. 


Weather conditions will affect the [[state]] of PCs. For example hot summer makes one more thirsty.


=== Strong wind ===  
Strong wind or deep snow may temporary slow characters. Extremely strong wind may even knock them down.  

In case the decreased speed persists even in indoor areas, see the description in [[Common_bugs#I_move_slower_then_I_should|common bugs]].

=== Lightning ===
There is a fairly low chance to get hit by a lightning in bad weather. The amount of damage character take is approximately proportional to how near the middle of the bolt is character located.
