==Climb Checks==
At some places in the module you need to pass a climb check to progress.

Climb checks are d20 + (level in relevant classes) + (str and dex mods) - (armour check penalty)

"Relevant classes" are fighter, rogue, assassin, ranger, arcane archer, harper, monk and barbarian.

The default DC is 30 but this can be overridden per location.

===Help===
People can help each other climb.  If another PC is nearby then you get their bonuses and penalties (classes, str/dex, armour check) added to your own.
