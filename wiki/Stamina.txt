=Overview=
Stamina is a "state" attribute, like hunger, thirst and rest.  As with the other state attributes, getting into negative stamina territory is a bad thing, and will drain your physical ability scores and give you a spell failure modifier due to exhaustion.

=Gaining and losing stamina=
Stamina is restored by resting, to a max of (your hitpoints) or 100, whichever is lower.  There are also various game effects that can give you stamina (e.g. see spells below).

Stamina drains at a very low rate every hour, but is mainly drained by doing exhausting things (like running), or being hit by some special attacks.

Casting arcane spells drains you of 1 stamina per spell level.

You can gain a pool of additional "stored" stamina as an arcanist by holding a ritual for other players, allowing you to gain a pool of stamina points that you will draw from automatically whenever your stamina goes to 10 or less.
