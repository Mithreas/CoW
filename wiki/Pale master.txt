=== Mechanical Changes ===
Every Pale Master level counts as two levels for the purposes of Death summons (especially Mummy Dust).   <br />
Every 2 Pale Master levels counts as +1 Caster Level for Spell Effects, Durations, Damage Dice and Dispel purposes (This does not apply for Spell Penetration).

==== Notes, Tips, and Interesting Bits: ====    
Deathless Vigor only increases hit points if obtained through class levels.  Buying the feat from the trainer will not grant additional hit points.   <br />
Wizards or Clerics who take only a single level of pale master still earn the ability to cast 8th circle spells but will need to memorize those spells from scrolls.  This is the only multi-class combination which retains the ability to cast 8th circle without taking bonus spell slots.   <br />
Having hide and move silently as class skills enables a spellcaster to qualify for assassin or shadowdancer.   <br />
