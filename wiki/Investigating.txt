[[Category: Unique Mechanics]]
Investigation is used for detective type mechanics.  It has three main uses.
- Questioning an NPC about which PCs they have seen recently.  Can be used e.g. if following someone through a city to check whether you're on the right track.
- Querying a bloodstain to determine information about what killed the creature that died there.
- And, most importantly, to uncover secret lore in the world.

To use, simply type -investigate near an object of interest.  If something is in range, your character will move to it and do the relevant investigation.

Secret lore is usually associated with something you can see, though not necessarily something you can click or interact with.  For example, a statue.  Secrets will have up to three levels of information available with progressively higher DCs. If your character has enough (modified) ranks in -both- Search and Lore to meet or exceed the DC - with no dice rolling - then you get a message with the information from that level.  You will automatically be tested against all three level (if they exist) for any investigation check you make; repeating the check will only give the exact same results every time.

Not all secrets have all three levels - some only have one or two.  If you only get one or two lines of information, that might be all there is, or coming back with a higher skill level might uncover more.
