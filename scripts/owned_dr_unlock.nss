  Description: This script belongs on the OnUnlock slot of a door or chest
  owned by an NPC. If an NPC is nearby when it is opened/destroyed and the
  NPC can see the PC who did the deed, then the PC gets their bounty increased
  for breaking in.
  
  The bounty defaults to the standard theft bounty (100) but you can override
  this by setting the BOUNTY var on the object in question.
